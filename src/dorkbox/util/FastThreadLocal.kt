/**
 * Fast {@code ThreadLocal} implementation, adapted from the
 * <a href="https://github.com/riven8192/LibStruct/blob/master/src/net/indiespot/struct/runtime/FastThreadLocal.java">LibStruct</a> library.
 *
 * <p>This implementation replaces the {@code ThreadLocalMap} lookup in {@link ThreadLocal} with a simple array access. The big advantage of this method is
 * that thread-local accesses are identified as invariant by the JVM, which enables significant code-motion optimizations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The underlying array contains a slot for each thread that uses the {@link FastThreadLocal} instance. The slot is indexed by {@link Thread#getId()}. The
 * array grows if necessary when the {@link #set} method is called.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is assumed that usages of this class will be read heavy, so any contention/false-sharing issues caused by the {@link #set} method are ignored.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the thread-local value type
