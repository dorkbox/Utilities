/**
 * Fast `ThreadLocal` implementation, adapted from the
 * [LibStruct](https://github.com/riven8192/LibStruct/blob/master/src/net/indiespot/struct/runtime/FastThreadLocal.java) library.
 *
 *
 * This implementation replaces the `ThreadLocalMap` lookup in [ThreadLocal] with a simple array access. The big advantage of this method is
 * that thread-local accesses are identified as invariant by the JVM, which enables significant code-motion optimizations.
 *
 *
 * The underlying array contains a slot for each thread that uses the [FastThreadLocal] instance. The slot is indexed by [Thread.getId]. The
 * array grows if necessary when the [.set] method is called.
 *
 *
 * It is assumed that usages of this class will be read heavy, so any contention/false-sharing issues caused by the [.set] method are ignored.
 *
 * @param <T> the thread-local value type
